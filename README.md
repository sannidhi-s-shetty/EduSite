# Python Math Game Using React

This project was created to handle the front-end from the Django-based Python Math Game [Website](https://math-game-django.herokuapp.com/).  The original project used Django for the front and back-end. [Here](https://github.com/Matthew-Hiebing/Python-Math-Game) is a link to the original Django project repo if you want check it out.

The newest version of this webpage uses React for the frontend and Django for the backend.  It can be found [here](https://math-game-react-frontend.herokuapp.com/).  The server may take some time to spin up, please be patient and/or refresh the page if its not working.

## Installation
First install [node](https://math-game-react-frontend.herokuapp.com/).  Once node is installed, install the following packages:

```bash
npm install axios 0.21.1

Some improvements that I may implement at a later date:\
1.) Difficulty Selection - Increasee or decrease the random integers that are used in the math problems.\
2.) Operator Selection - Allow users to select what type of math problems they want to see.\
3.) Problem Batch Mode - Give the users pre-made batches of problems instead of one at a time.\
4.) Improved Stats Analysis - Give the teacher a better overview of the students performance using graphs/charts.
